Overview
--------

circuits-minpor provides a minimal portal component based on the
the `circuits framework`_. Read the `Package Documentation`_
for details.

The source is maintained at `github`_. Please use the `issue tracker`_ 
there to report any issues.

Requirements
------------

circuits-minpor depends on the `Python Standard Library`_,
the `circuits framework`_ in the upcoming 1.7 version,
the general purpose `circuits_bricks` components and the
`rbtranslations` library. Both circuits bricks and the
resource bundle translations library are small libraries
that have been developed in parallel with the portal
component. They have been singled out because they have
proven to be useful independent of this portal component. 

Installation
------------

The simplest and recommended way to install circuits-minpor is with 
easy_install::

    > easy_install circuits-minpor

Alternatively, you may download the source package from the
`circuits-minpor Page on PyPI`_ or from `github`_, extract it 
and install using::

    > python setup.py install
